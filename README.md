# Etch A Sketch

## Overview
This is the day 19 project A of the course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. The Etch-A-Sketch program replicates the classic drawing toy, allowing users to control a turtle to draw on the screen using keyboard inputs.


## How It Works
- **Drawing Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the turtle:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move the turtle forward.
  - **Down Arrow**: Move the turtle backward.
  - **Left Arrow**: Rotate the turtle left.
  - **Right Arrow**: Rotate the turtle right.
- **Clearing the Screen**: Press the "c" key to clear the screen and reset the turtle to its initial position at the center.
- **Interactive Drawing**: The turtle draws lines on the screen based on its movement and direction, simulating the drawing effect of an Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)
